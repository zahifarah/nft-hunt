# nft-hunt

NFT Hunt is a gamified marketplace in which users can track down NFTs anywhere in the world.
Whether it's a new song, an animated renaissance style painting or a unique piece of armor for that indie game you're playing; access a new layer of
interaction between artists and collectors at the touch of your fingertips.

This project is part of the Chainlink Hackathon Spring 2021.
